L. Tembe little while ago.\n\nAt the outset, I thank Prof. Seshu (Director) for giving me the opportunity\nto serve as Dean (Student Welfare) and giving me the freedom, guidance and\nsupport during my tenure.  His monumental support and confidence reposed in\nme gave me enthusiasm to overcome all the challenges posed in the initial\ndays of getting the hostels, mess ready.\n\nI sincerely thank Prof. Nagesh Iyer (Dean IPS), Prof. Prasanna (Dean R&D\nand Faculty Welfare) for their support in the thick and thin of my tenure.\n\n\nI sincerely thank all our faculty (especially wardens, mess wardens).  Their\nsupport has made us overcome all the problems and execute things in time. I\nstill remember, Prof. Amlan, Prof. Rajeshwara Rao was so much involved in\npurchasing all the equipment required for the mess.  Prof. Amlan and Prof.\nKoushik Saha saw us through the difficulties of handling of mess for the\nyear 2018-2019.  I thank all the wardens who were religiously involved in\nhandling all the issues of students in the nascent stage.  Sometimes, I\nused to wonder am I worthy enough to execute all this. I salute all the\nwardens for their faith in the system and their complete surrender to the\ndeliverance of perfect wardenship. They never deterred from the problems\nwhich we were facing.  They made all insurmountable tasks into simple ones\nand executed them with ease.  I personally thank Prof. Gopal and Prof.\nNilkamal who have taken up the present mess wardenship. They are doing a\nwonderful job and I have complete confidence that they will take care of\nour messes properly.  Nothing can be achieved without enthusiasm.  I think\nthe sheer enthusiasm of our faculty will instill confidence in our students\nabout our hostel operating systems.\n\nI sincerely thank Mr. Nagaraja (earlier OSD), Nageshrao (OSD), Assistant\nRegistrars (Mr. Sandeep, Mr. Anil Dhankar, Mr. Anupam) and all office staff\nfor their support in taking care of all hostels, messes and students. My\nsincere thanks to Mr. Anupam Joshi who was keen in getting all the services\n(ambulance, mess, etc) in time and making sure that they provide better\nservices.  My sincere thanks to Mr. Anil Dhankar and Ms. Swetha for getting\nall the infrastructure to the hostels in time.\n\nMy sincere thanks to Mr. Bhendigeri who is our caretaker of Keeravani\nhostel. Without his support, it is next to impossible to take care of the\nconcerns of all first year students.  My sincere thanks to Mr. Ravi\nGhalimath and Ms. Sujatha for their support in the allocation of hostel\nrooms, getting the infrastructure in place in the hostels.  My sincere\nthanks to all the staff (Mr. Gurusiddappa, Mr. Vinod Kulkarni, Mr. Anand,\nMr. Giridhar, Mr. Chidanand, Ms. Ashwini, Ms. Farheen, Mr. Shrikant, Mr.\nSambaji) for helping in the deliverance of service to students.\n\n\n\nLast but not least, I sincerely thank all students, hostel secretaries who\nmade this journey possible and memorable. Students have been extremely\nhelpful in making our hostels better places to stay.  It is their\nsuggestions which have paved way to the improvement of the operation of our\nhostels and messes.   My sincere apologies to those whom I have missed out\nin thanking anyone for their contributions.\n\n I am sure, you all will continue your support to Prof. Tembe in delivering\nhis duties and responsibilities as Dean (Student Welfare).\n\n\n\n Yours sincerely,\n\nPrabhu\n\n\nMy failures have been errors in judgement, not of intent (ULYSSES S.

Know that the faculty are facing\ndifficulties to perform their research as well. This is a problem that\naffects us all.\n\nThe issue is not with the WiFi network, but instead with the Internet\nconnectivity of the institute itself. All premier institutions like the\nIITs are to get their Internet connectivity through the National Knowledge\nNetwork (NKN) initiative of the Government of India. Under this, we are\ncurrently receiving a bandwidth of 100 Mbps, and are eligible for an\nupgrade to 1 Gbps. We have given our request for upgradation over a year\nago. However, due to issues within NKN we are still waiting for it. We are\ncontinually pressurizing them through different channels. The latest\npromise is that the upgradation will be done in a few weeks.\n\nWe have taken a secondary connection of another 100 Mbps from BSNL. It\nseems that our requirements during peak loads are higher than the available\n200 Mbps.\n\nWe are also trying to add a tertiary connection of 1 Gbps. Various Internet\nproviders have been contacted. They have visited our premises and are\npreparing their feasibility reports.\n\nWe are pursuing all available options to resolve this at the earliest\n\nYours sincerely\nProf Rajshekhar\n\n>\n> ---------- Forwarded message ----------\n> From: *Career Development Cell* <cdc@iitdh.ac.in>\n> Date: Tuesday, February 5, 2019\n> Subject: Lack of basic necessities in IIT Dharwad\n> To: P Seshu <Director@iitdh.ac.in>, Dean Student Welfare <\n> dean.sw@iitdh.ac.in>\n> Cc: Students <students@iitdh.ac.in>\n>\n>\n> Sir\n> I am extremely sorry to inform you about the poor conditions of basic\n> necessities in our institute.\n>\n> Every floor in the academic area has a water cooler machine but has anyone\n> checked out of them how many actually works?

Her views on women's rights issues are as relevant in the\nmodern times.\n\n\nBorn on 3 April 1903 in Mangalore, Kamladevi gradually emerged as one of\nthe few feminist freedom fighters the country has seen. Even after India's\nindependence in 1947,  she continued to work for the refugees and also\ncontributed to the cultural landscape. The Google doodle offers glimpses of\nher body of work. Kamaladevi Chattopadhyay was a driving force behind\nsetting up of key cultural institutions in the country including National\nSchool of Drama, World Crafts Council and Sangeet Natak Academy.\n\n\nShe lost her father at the age of seven, was married at the age of 14 and\nlost her husband at the age of 16. A widow at a very young age, Kamladevi\ntravelled to London to study. She joined Indian National Congress in 1927\nand gradually became the first Indian woman to be arrested by British for\nentering Bombay Stock Exchange and sell packets of contraband salt in 1930.\nIn fact, Kamladevi - a rebel in her own right -  also disagreed with\nMahatama Gandhi when he opposed inclusion of women in salt satyagraha.\n\n\nShe was also the first Indian women to run for a political office. In 1926,\nafter she met the founder of All India Women's Congress, Margaret Cousins,\nKamladevi contested for a seat in Madras Legislative assembly, however, she\nlost by just 55 votes.\n\n\nIn her memoir, she stressed on how \"women had no rights\" at that time. She\nalso pressed for Uniform Civil Code to ensure gender equality and often\nvoiced her opinion against child marriage. During her travels to the United\nStates, she befriended many American feminists to expand her worldview.\n\n\n\nIndian author Raja Rao described the social reformer as \"perhaps the most\naugust woman on the Indian scene today. Firmly Indian and therefore\nuniversal, highly sophisticated both in sensibility and intelligence, she\nwalks with everyone, in city and country with utter simplicity.\"\n\n\nShe died on October 29, 1988.\n","67":"Subject: DevHack 2019 Results\nText: Hello everyone,\nFinally, the wait is over!\n\nVisit the Website Link <https://devhack2019.github.io/> to check out the\nresults for DevHack 2019.\n\nSonu Sourav\nDevHack Team\n","68":"Subject: Re: ASME Journals\nText: Dear Shri Bhendigeri:\n\nI could access and download articles from ASME!\n\nThanks very much to the whole Library team that worked tirelessly to get\naccess to online resources through eShodhSindhu.\n\nBest regards\n\nProf. P.

Large equipment cannot be used in wet, muddy,\n> and uneven fields; it cannot be used when the crop canopy grows; and it is\n> expensive. Furthermore, practices like blanket spraying, tilling, and the\n> increasing size of equipment are leading to critical sustainability\n> problems: Herbicide resistant weeds, soil compaction, increasing carbon\n> footprints, and pesticide runoff are just a few of these problems. The\n> focus of this talk is on the new breed of lightweight, compact, and highly\n> autonomous field robots that my group is creating and deploying in fields\n> across the US: TerraSentia. I will also discuss new algorithms for robust\n> long-duration autonomy in harsh, changing, and uncertain\n> environments, including deep learning for robot embedded vision, deep\n> adversarial reinforcement learning for large state-action spaces, and\n> transfer learning for deep reinforcement learning domains..\n>\n>\n> Speaker Bio:\n> Girish Chowdhary is an assistant professor at the University of Illinois\n> at Urbana-Champaign with the Coordinated Science Laboratory, and the\n> director of the Distributed Autonomous Systems laboratory at UIUC. At\n> UIUC, Girish is affiliated with Agricultural and Biological Engineering,\n> Aerospace Engineering, Computer Science, and Electrical Engineering. He\n> holds a PhD (2010) from Georgia Institute of Technology in Aerospace\n> Engineering. He was a postdoc at the Laboratory for Information and\n> Decision Systems (LIDS) of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n> (2011-2013), and an assistant professor at Oklahoma State University’s\n> Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department (2013-2016). He also\n> worked with the German Aerospace Center's (DLR's) Institute of Flight\n> Systems for around three years (2003-2006).

Equipment manufacturers have been\nautomating large agricultural equipment – tractors, harvesters, and even\nexcavators; but automating large equipment only addresses a part of the\nagricultural labor crisis. Large equipment cannot be used in wet, muddy,\nand uneven fields; it cannot be used when the crop canopy grows; and it is\nexpensive. Furthermore, practices like blanket spraying, tilling, and the\nincreasing size of equipment are leading to critical sustainability\nproblems: Herbicide resistant weeds, soil compaction, increasing carbon\nfootprints, and pesticide runoff are just a few of these problems. The\nfocus of this talk is on the new breed of lightweight, compact, and highly\nautonomous field robots that my group is creating and deploying in fields\nacross the US: TerraSentia. I will also discuss new algorithms for robust\nlong-duration autonomy in harsh, changing, and uncertain\nenvironments, including deep learning for robot embedded vision, deep\nadversarial reinforcement learning for large state-action spaces, and\ntransfer learning for deep reinforcement learning domains..\n\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nGirish Chowdhary is an assistant professor at the University of Illinois\nat Urbana-Champaign with the Coordinated Science Laboratory, and the\ndirector of the Distributed Autonomous Systems laboratory at UIUC. At\nUIUC, Girish is affiliated with Agricultural and Biological Engineering,\nAerospace Engineering, Computer Science, and Electrical Engineering. He\nholds a PhD (2010) from Georgia Institute of Technology in Aerospace\nEngineering. He was a postdoc at the Laboratory for Information and\nDecision Systems (LIDS) of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n(2011-2013), and an assistant professor at Oklahoma State University’s\nMechanical and Aerospace Engineering department (2013-2016). He also\nworked with the German Aerospace Center's (DLR's) Institute of Flight\nSystems for around three years (2003-2006). Girish's ongoing research\ninterest is in theoretical insights and practical algorithms for adaptive\nautonomy, with a particular focus on field-robotics. He has authored over\n90 peer reviewed publications in various areas of adaptive control,\nrobotics, and autonomy. On the practical side, Girish has led the\ndevelopment and flight-testing of over 10 research UAS platform. UAS\nautopilots based on Girish’s work have been designed and flight-tested on\nsix UASs, including by independent international institutions. Girish is\nan investigator on NSF, AFOSR, NASA, ARPA-E, and DOE grants. He is the\nwinner of the Air Force Young Investigator Award, the Aerospace Guidance\nand Controls Systems Committee Dave Ward Memorial award, and several best\npaper awards.

More recently, reinforcement\nlearning has been gaining popularity in solving problems that are\ntypically difficult to solve through traditional control techniques. RL\nalgorithms promise to learn joint perception-planning-control policies\ndirectly from data. However, despite their successes, RL algorithms still\ncannot guarantee safety and stability for engineered systems, and haven’t\nyet replicated the ability of animals to transfer knowledge between\nprogressively harder tasks. In this talk, I will sketch my group’s pursuit\ntowards developing learning-based controllers for autonomous systems.\nStarting from model reference adaptive control with concurrent learning\nand Gaussian Processes (GPs), I will outline our journey to reinforcement\nlearning with GP Q-learning. I will then discuss our recent work on\nadversarial deep reinforcement learning, and finally arrive at a\nreimagining of reinforcement learning from the perspective of adaptation\nfor policy transfer.\n\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nGirish Chowdhary is an assistant professor at the University of Illinois\nat Urbana-Champaign with the Coordinated Science Laboratory, and the\ndirector of the Distributed Autonomous Systems laboratory at UIUC. At\nUIUC, Girish is affiliated with Agricultural and Biological Engineering,\nAerospace Engineering, Computer Science, and Electrical Engineering. He\nholds a PhD (2010) from Georgia Institute of Technology in Aerospace\nEngineering. He was a postdoc at the Laboratory for Information and\nDecision Systems (LIDS) of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n(2011-2013), and an assistant professor at Oklahoma State University’s\nMechanical and Aerospace Engineering department (2013-2016). He also\nworked with the German Aerospace Center's (DLR's) Institute of Flight\nSystems for around three years (2003-2006). Girish's ongoing research\ninterest is in theoretical insights and practical algorithms for adaptive\nautonomy, with a particular focus on field-robotics. He has authored over\n90 peer reviewed publications in various areas of adaptive control,\nrobotics, and autonomy. On the practical side, Girish has led the\ndevelopment and flight-testing of over 10 research UAS platform. UAS\nautopilots based on Girish’s work have been designed and flight-tested on\nsix UASs, including by independent international institutions. Girish is\nan investigator on NSF, AFOSR, NASA, ARPA-E, and DOE grants. He is the\nwinner of the Air Force Young Investigator Award, the Aerospace Guidance\nand Controls Systems Committee Dave Ward Memorial award, and several best\npaper awards. He is the co-founder of EarthSense Inc., working to make\nultralight outdoor robotics a reality.\n--\nRegards,\nNaveen\n","165":"Subject: Invitation for SPHINX 2.0: The Annual Technical Festival of MNIT Jaipur\nText: Following the success of our biggest tech-fest SPHINX’18, we take the\nopportunity to proudly invite you to its revamped edition, SPHINX 2.0, the\nAnnual Technical Festival of Malaviya National of Technology, Jaipur, which\nwill be held in the campus, commencing from 27th to 29th September 2018.\nThe fest is a unique confluence of technical events and extravagant\ncultural activities.\n\nThis festival marks a 3-day long convergence of brilliant technological\nevents like Hackathons, ROBOTICS Events, Core Engineering Events, Labyrinth\n(Gaming Competition).

Do what it takes to let out that pent-up\nsteam - go for a quick walk, talk it out with a trusted colleague or reach\nout to an expert for help.\n*2. Confront the worst-case scenario*\nRather than struggling to avoid the negative thoughts, try dwelling on\nthem. Stare them in the face and approach with a steadfast resolution to\novercome them.\n*3. Apologise and earn back the trust*\nBy holding yourself accountable, you show that you can be trusted to fix\nthings. Take personal accountability for restoring trust, and gradually\nwork towards rebuilding it with consistent great work.\n*4. Use your mistake as an opportunity to learn*\nMistakes help you strengthen your character. They are a critical part of\nyour life and you must learn to embrace them with an open heart and open\nmind.\n*5. Stop beating yourself up*\nNothing is good when done in excess, especially self-criticism. Instead of\nhelping you reach your goals, this excessive inner criticism will end up\ndisrupting your health and peace of mind.\n*Made a big mistake in an internship? **Release your feelings of grief and\nshame with the help of our experts.*\n\nconnect to an expert now\n<https://yourdost.com/chatSession/?workgroup=demo@workgroup.chat.yourdost.com&yd_source=IITDh_NL&yd_medium=IITDhMail&yd_campaign=BlundersAtWork&yd_term=19>\n\n*PS.

It is even more so when the product, as in the robotics domain,\nis multi-disciplinary in nature and entails diverse skill sets across\ndesign, development, manufacturing, sales and service. Problem solving\nskills that need to be developed beyond the classroom to address real-world\nissues will be illustrated with a few case studies across multiple\ndisciplines. At a higher level the fundamentals in our eco-system that\nimpede the full intellectual potential of India to be leveraged to realize\nglobally competitive products can be debated.\n\nShort biography of the speaker:\nDr. Jagannath Raju is the Chief Technology Officer of Systemantics, and is\nresponsible for the company’s product development and technology strategy.\nHe incubates product ideas based on market requirements and leads their\ndevelopment into full-fledged products. His consulting experience in the\nUSA covers development of innovative robotic systems for space, underwater\nand hazardous applications for projects funded by NASA, Federal Sea Grant\nProgram, Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation. He also\nserved as a consultant in the Boston area to many companies involved in\nrobotics and automation R&D, especially in semiconductor fabrication and\nhandling, and was a visiting scientist at the Mechanical Engineering\nLaboratory, Tsukuba, Japan under a fellowship from Japan’s Ministry of\nInternational Trade and Industry.\n\nAfter relocating back to India in 1994 he worked as a consultant to the\nCenter for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Bangalore for the\ndevelopment of a controller for a robotic inspection platform before\nfounding Systemantics in 1995. His expertise covers many areas of\ntechnology relevant to robotic systems, viz., mechanical design, actuator\nand sensors, computer control, signal and power electronics and embedded\nand application software.

The research on this particular topic was pioneered\nby Davalos-Orozco and Ruiz-Chavarria (Physics of Fluids, 1992). They\nconsidered a fluid layer flowing down a rotating inclined plane and only\ncaptured the effect of the Coriolis force on the instability phenomenon by\nlinear stability analysis. Later, Davalos-Orozco and Busse (Physical Review\nE, 2002) extended this research by considering the effect of Coriolis as\nwell as centrifugal forces but unable to analyze the nonlinear stability.\n\nWe have extended the work of  Davalos-Orozco and Busse, firstly by\nanalyzing the nonlinear stability of their problem and secondly, we have\nused a new technique, called the \"momentum-integral\" method, to discuss the\ninstability phenomenon.\n","278":"Subject: Lost a watch in the gym\nText: Hey\nYesterday I forgot my watch on the window side in the warmup room of the\ngym.If anyone finds it , he is requested to give it to me.\nContact no : 8095346834\n\nRegards,\nAshutosh Agarwal\n","279":"Subject: Discrete mathematics... by Rosen\nText: Hello Guys\n\nPlease return the following book immediately which is overdue\n\nDiscrete mathematics and its applications\nKenneth Rosen\n\nWBW\n\nOmprakash Bhendigeri\n","280":"Subject: Re: Oxford Scholarship online\nText: Dear All\n\nI have forgotten to provide URL for the product which is as follows\n\nwww.oxfordscholarship.com\n\n   1.\n   <http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Zuu95WPf9D0J:www.oxfordscholarship.com/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=in>\n   2.\n   <https://www.google.co.in/search?rlz=1C1CHZL_enIN754IN754&q=related:www.oxfordscholarship.com/+oxfordscholarship&tbo=1&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjZtO7SpLfaAhXFMY8KHZ-eCbQQHwgqMAA>\n\n\nThanks and Regards\n\nOmprakash Bhendigeri\n\n\n\nOn Fri, Apr 13, 2018 at 2:36 PM, Omprakash Bhendigiri <omprakash@iitdh.ac.in\n> wrote:\n\n> Dear All\n>\n> An Academic Full Text resource from Oxford University Press is on TRIAL\n>\n> Collection of nearly 15000 books one can search (top right) entire\n> collection.\n>\n> Browse subject wise and later Refine by Subdivisions of Subject, year of\n> publications etc can be done.\n>\n> Results will appear in HTML format.

It is by David Janků of the *Effective Thesis Project*\nhttp://effectivethesis.com (see end of posting for more details). Czech\nAssociation for Effective Altruism www.efektivni-altruismus.cz Reprinted\nwith permission.\n\nNOTE: Please feel free to Get in touch and give us feedback  - The\nEffective Thesis Project.\n\nRegards,\n\nRick Reis\n\nreis@stanford.edu\n\nUP NEXT: The Great Conference Con?\n\nTomorrow’s Research\n\n---------- 1,278 words ----------\n\nHow to Choose a Thesis Topic\n\n Finding a good thesis topic is hard. I first experienced this problem\nmyself in the final year of my bachelor studies. I was ready to work hard\non my final thesis, devote hundreds of hours and exceptional effort to it\nas these bigger projects always motivated me. Also, it was something\ntangible to finish my studies with and I wanted to finish with a “great\nparade”. However, I was still unsure about what exactly it was that I was\ngoing to devote so much time and effort to. I was in turmoil with almost no\nadvice at hand and most of my classmates felt the same. In the end, they\nended up taking some easily accessible topic they hadn’t thought about very\nmuch. I was lucky enough to roughly know which area I was interested in but\nhad no idea what specific questions to ask. When I heard that one of the\nteachers specializing in that area offered ready-made topics I didn’t wait\na second, made an appointment with him an agreed to work on the first topic\nhe proposed. I didn’t know anything about it, but I was ready to learn more\nand the feeling of not having to search for a topic for next several weeks\nwas invaluable.\n\nThat was when I understood that choosing a topic is really hard. However,\nit’s the most important part of the research process. When I reflected\nback, it was hard to believe how little attention all of us gave to such an\nimportant part of the writing process where we would invest hundreds of\nhours and huge effort over the next many months. When I finished my\nbachelor studies, I decided I wanted to try and chance things. I found that\npeople from what was called “the effective altruism community” did long\nresearch into which world problems are most pressing\n<https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/> and that many of these\nproblems lacked research attention. “When there is a lack of research on\nthe one hand and thousands of students desperately looking for a topic on\nthe other, why not help them all?” flashed through my mind. That was when I\nfirst came upon the idea of setting up effectivethesis.com\n<http://effectivethesis.com/>.\n\nEffective Thesis is a project that offers students topics for their final\ntheses and dissertations that are meaningful and have a high potential to\nsignificantly improve the world. We have decided to offer help in this\nregard in two ways: (1) putting up a list of topics in need of research in\nwhich students can surf and match themselves with a topic they feel is a\ngood fit and (2) providing individual coaching for those students who\ncouldn’t find a fit with any topic on our list. Below, I describe both of\nthese services in more detail.\n\nList of topics\n\nWe started our project by putting together a list of important topics\n<http://effectivethesis.com/theses/> that lacked research attention. Since\nno list like that existed, we decided to ask organizations working on some\nof the world’s most pressing problems\n<https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/> what would they need to\nknow to make significant progress in their cause. We transformed their\nresponses into topic profiles, containing not only description of the\ntopic, but also justification of why the topic is important and a link to\nrelevant literature to provide a head start for those interested in the\ntopic. We also arranged with these organizations to provide consultations\nto students who choose one of their topics to ensure high practical utility\nof the student’s work. Via consultations, organizations can check whether\nstudents are answering the right question in their research and also\nprovide some useful theoretical and practical tips to improve the research\nand make it more relevant. For better orientation we included filter\nfunctions to allow students to filter topics by their study discipline and\narea of interest stemming from the most pressing global problems. The list\nhas now more than 200 topics in 21 study disciplines and is still growing.\n\nCreating a list of important topics was a good start, however, there were\nadditional issues that needed to be addresses. First, we found that good\nfit of a topic might differ for students optimizing for highest social\nimpact of their thesis, improving their general career prospects or\npreparing for a research career. Whereas topics in our list will help\nstudents to contribute to solving some of the most pressing global problems\nand therefore have high social impact, it may not always help them obtain a\njob or prepare for a research career. Therefore, we have written three\ninstructional articles <http://effectivethesis.com/how-choose-thesis/>to\nprovide students with advice in these three instances.\n\nWe have also found that some topics we proposed were too broad and would\nrequire narrowing down, that some students couldn’t find a supervisor at\ntheir faculty for a topic they liked and that some students were struggling\nto assess whether they are a good fit for the topic they chose with their\nskills and longer term career plans. Therefore, we created another service\nto address these issues.\n\nThesis Topic Coaching\n\nTo account for the above mentioned issues, we decided to take a more\nindividual path by providingindividual coaching\n<http://effectivethesis.com/thesis-coaching/>. In the coaching process, a\ncoach takes into account factors such as longer term career goals,\nsupervisor availability, students’ interests, skills, experience and course\nrequirements and comes up with a choice of few topics tailored made to\nstudent’s circumstances. In an online call, student and coach then discuss\ncoaches’ suggestions and design the final form of the topic. If students\ndon’t prefer any of the suggested topics, they may clarify their\nexpectations and the coach will try to suggest a new set of topics based on\ntheir clarification. The coach will not help students with thesis writing\nitself, but if students decide to work on one the proposed topics, we will\ntry to connect them with external researchers or organizations working on\nthe same problem.\n\nEffective Thesis is a charitable project that aims to direct research into\nareas deemed crucial to significantly improving the world that at the same\ntime lack research attention. There is no cost to the students. The only\nexpectation is that the students will conduct as high-quality research as\npossible and the Effective Thesis Project will do everything in its\ncapacity to help with that! Get in touch\n<http://effectivethesis.com/thesis-coaching/> and make your thesis\nmeaningful!\n\nAbout the Effective Thesis Project\n\n*The Effective Thesis project aims to focus research on areas that have the\npotential to greatly improve the world. A lot of skilled and talented\npeople at universities find themselves in a situation where they have to\nwrite a large final thesis (bachelor, diploma, Ph.D.) at least once during\ntheir studies. Many of them find it difficult to choose a topic and end up\ngiving much time and effort into a paper that only serves as a means to get\ntheir degree, with almost no subsequent applications. But when there is so\nmuch energy invested in the thesis, why not choose a topic that will, on\nthe top of gaining you a diploma, benefit and help someone else?*\n\n*Our coaches have broad and deep overview of **the most pressing global\nissues* <https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/> *and people\nworking on them, so they can offer students topics tailored to their\nexpertise and situation. When students choose one of our topics, we will\nalso try to connect them with people both within academia and practice\nworking on the same issue to ensure highest possible quality and utility of\nstudents’ work.*\n\n\n\n\"Desktop faculty development 100 times per year.\"\nOver 65,000 subscribers at over 950 institutions in more than 100 countries\n\nTOMORROW'S PROFESSOR eMAIL NEWSLETTER <http://tomprof.stanford.edu/>\n\nArchives of all past postings can be found here\n<http://tomprof.stanford.edu/>:\n\nSponsored by the Office of the Vice Provost of Teaching and Learning\n<http://vptl.stanford.edu/> at Stanford University\n\nNOTE: To SUBSCRIBE or UNSUBSCRIBE to the Tomorrows-Professor List click HERE\n<https://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/tomorrows-professor>\n\n--++**==--++**==--++**==--++**==--++**==--++**==--++**==\ntomorrows-professor mailing list\ntomorrows-professor@lists.stanford.edu\nhttps://mailman.stanford.edu/mailman/listinfo/tomorrows-professor\n","332":"Subject: Fwd: [Fwd: Artificial Intelligence Day at IIMB]\nText: Hello Sir/Madam ,\n\nData Centre and Analytics Lab (DCAL), IIM Bangalore in association with\nIBM Research - India is organising 'Research AI Day' on 29 June, 2019 at\nIIMB.

It is highly\nrecommended not to use the equipment in the weightlifting room because it\nis extremely dangerous to use the weights without supervision of trained\npersonnel. Also it was observed that people leave the bar with the weights\non the stands after use. This causes the bars to bend and lose grip making\nthem unfit for future use. So kindly refrain from using the weightlifting\nequipment if you don't have any previous experience with them.\n\nAlso it is to be noted that weightlifting club and gym are not related to\neach other at all.

The details of\nthe scheduled talk is as follows:\n\n*Date*: 13th August, 2018\n\n*Time*: 4.00 pm to 5.00 pm\n\n*Venue*: Room No. 119\n\n*Title: Flexible substrate based nanoelectronic devices for applications in\nbroadband photodetectors and smart personal healthcare monitoring*\n\n\n*Abstract: *\n\nConventional electronic devices fabricated on rigid crystalline\nsemiconductors wafers have evolved with the motivation to miniaturize\nthereby realizing faster, smaller and densely integrated devices. A\nparallel research that is rapidly evolving for future electronics is to\nintegrate the property of flexibility and stretchablity of substrates to\ndevelop human friendly devices. While most reports on photodetectors focus\non improving the responsivity in one region of electromagnetic spectrum by\nfabricating 2D materials hybrids, the main issue which remains unaddressed\nis the inability to absorb wide range of electromagnetic spectrum. The\nfirst part of the talk focuses on the development of flexible broadband\nphotodetectors based on MoS2 and their hybrids. Also, ways to improve the\nresponsivity of flexible photodetectors will be discussed in terms of\nstrain modulation and Piezotronics. Second part of the talk will cover the\nother research activities in the field of flexible and wearable\nelectronics. This includes wireless smart low-cost multifunctional sensors\nfor personal healthcare applications, fabrication of artificial electronic\nskin (e-skin) based on eraser, and graphene based flexible temperature and\ninfrared sensor on polyimide substrate.\n\n\n\n*Speaker's biography:* Dr. Parikshit Sahatiya received his Ph.D. from IIT\nHyderabad, Electrical Engineering Department and was a Research Associate\nat IIT Hyderabad for 3 months. He is currently working as a Research\nScientist at Redpine Signals in association with IITH for the fabrication\nof flexible resistive memory (memresistor). His research interest includes\nfabrication of flexible and wearable nanoelectronic devices for IoT\napplications and exploring emerging 2D materials for sensing applications\nand flexible memristors. Dr. Parikshit has authored 22 publications in\npeer-reviewed journals, out of which 17 are first author publications. For\nhis Ph.D. work, Dr. Parikshit has received “Best Project Award”, Indian\nNanoelectronics User Program, IITB for the year 2017 for his work on\nmultifunctional wireless sensors and has been nominated for Best Thesis\nAward 2018 by INAE.\n\n\nPlease make it convenient to attend the talk.\n\n\nBest Regards,\nRuma\n\n-- \nDr. Ruma Ghosh\n\nAssistant Professor\nElectrical Engineering Department,\nIIT Dharwad, Karnataka-580004\nPh.- +91 8362212849\n","396":"Subject: Swimming pool registration\nText: Dear all,\n\nSwimming pool registration starring from 3rd October 2018 , at Bhoopali\nbuilding in the sports office and swimming registration fee is RS. 200 for\nthe five months\nRegistration last day is ON OR BEFORE  5th October 2018 Friday 3:00 PM\nHow r registered for the swimming pool only those students only can access\nthe swimming pool.\n","397":"Subject: Reminder: Announcement of Talk on 14th Nov., 2018; from 2:30 to 3:30 PM; Room-119.\nText: Dear All,\n\nThis is a gentle reminder for today's talk as per details given in the\nappended email.\n\nThanking you,\n\nYours truly,\nR Prabhu\n\n\nOn Mon, Nov 12, 2018, 7:51 AM Dr. R.

In the first part of the talk, we report experiments on\n> an agarose gel tablet loaded with camphoric acid (c-boat) spontaneously set\n> into motion by surface tension gradients on the water surface. We observe\n> three distinct modes of c-boat motion: harmonic mode where the c-boat speed\n> oscillates sinusoidally in time, a steady mode where the c-boat maintains\n> constant speed, and an intermittent mode where the c-boat maintains\n> near-zero speed between sudden jumps in speed. Whereas all three modes have\n> been separately reported before in different systems, controlled release of\n> camphoric acid from the agarose gel matrix allowed the observation of all\n> the three modes in the same system. In the second part, we report\n> self-propulsion of liquid drops on a liquid surface. The dynamics involved\n> are quite rich in comparison to that of a particle on liquid surface as a\n> liquid drop exhibits motion, deformation and break up. In this regard, we\n> experimentally study the motion of an Octanoic Acid drop on aqueous\n> solutions of octanoic acid. In the current work, we study a regime where\n> triple line undulations result in varying Marangoni propulsion and a random\n> walking drop. We discuss two parametric regimes where the drop motion\n> exhibits a Levy walk and a near-Gaussian random walk. We present mean\n> squared displacement, probability distributions of step lengths as well as\n> from velocity auto-correlations from observations of the drop motion as\n> evidence. Finally, we show that the drop `foraging' mimics a living system.\n>\n> *Brief Biodata (Sic):* My primary interest is in the area of Soft\n> Condensed Matter Physics.

Lung cancer is the leading\ncause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Pathologically, Lung cancer is\nsubcategorized in two subtypes: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and\nSmall cell lung cancer (SCLC). NSCLC, a subtype of lung cancer, contributes\nabout 85% of total lung cancer-related deaths. Myc, a transcription factor,\nis one of the most critical oncogenes and is deregulated frequently in\nalmost all the cancer types, including Lung cancer. LncRNA, a relatively\nnovel class of RNA, has shown to play a crucial role in cancer development\nand progression. Many studies have been done to decipher the role of\nLncRNAs in cancer development. However, a significant proportion of LncRNAs\nremain unexplored. Here, we aim to identify the Myc regulated LncRNAs in\nLung cancer and characterize their function in lung cancer. We have\nperformed various bioinformatics analysis to identify RP11-132A1.4 as the\nputative target of Myc in lung cancer. In the present work, I have knocked\ndown the level of Myc in A549 and H460 cell and check the expression of\nRP11-132A1.4.

Rohan, an 18 year old man, had joined\none of the country’s premier engineering colleges. He was always a high\nachiever, being his school topper for the most part. Rohan arrived on\ncampus full of energy and confidence.\nEverything was going fine, till the first quiz results came out. Rohan\nfound his name in the bottom 10 performers. He was in complete shock. His\nconfidence and self-esteem hit rock bottom. He felt he was inferior to his\npeers, and started isolating himself more and more as his academic\nperformance, in his opinion, continued to be “under par”.\nThis was the state in which Rohan approached YourDOST. He felt like a\ncomplete failure. Over the next few weeks, he and Archana, a YourDOST\nexpert, worked together to challenge his harsh self-judgement.

Because of this, all our power supply lines (especially fuses)\nhave gotten affected seriously.\n\n\n\nYesterday, we had a crisis-like situation. Thanks to the efforts of our\ninstitute team, we could get water pumped to the overhead tank. We could\nget the power supply line to all the hostels behind, street lights and\nBhoopali mess from HESCOM restored with extreme difficulty.\n\n\n\nStill, we are not able to get the power supply from HESCOM to Keeravani and\nacademic building.  We are trying various technical avenues to fix this\nissue.  We are in continuous touch with the HESCOM team who is working\ncontinually for us.  Our team also is working on this issue to get the\nHESCOM power restored by today evening.\n\n\n\nIn case, if we cannot get the power restored from HESCOM, we are going to\nmanage bare essentials (water supply, cooking of food in the mess and hot\nwater bath) with the generators on.  Diesel is available in premium as\nHubli and Dharwad are cut off from Mumbai.  Hence, diesel generators would\nbe kept on only for two hours in the morning (5 AM – 7.00 AM) and two hours\nin the evening (4 PM – 6 PM) for next three days (10th August to 12th\nAugust 2019) for mess connections only.\n\n\n\nI hope, as to-be-engineers, you will appreciate (understand) the situation\nand use all essential items (water and electricity) in a frugal manner.

Interactions of\nturbulence, molecular transport, and energy transport, coupled with\nchemistry play a crucial role in the evolution of flame surface geometry,\npropagation, annihilation, and local extinction/reignition characteristics\nof intensely turbulent premixed flames.\n\nThe present study seeks to understand how these interactions affect flame\nsurface annihilation of lean hydrogen–air premixed turbulent flames. Direct\nnumerical simulations (DNS) are conducted at different parametric\nconditions with a detailed reaction mechanism and transport properties for\nhydrogen–air flames. Flame particle tracking (FPT) technique is used to\nfollow specific flame surface segments. An analytical expression for the\nlocal flame displacement speed (*S*d) of an isotherm is considered, and the\ncontributions of transport, chemistry, and kinematics on the flame\ndisplacement speed at different turbulence flame interaction conditions are\nidentified. In general, the flame displacement speed for the flame\nparticles is found to increase with time for all conditions considered.\nThis is because, eventually all flame surfaces and their resident flame\nparticles approach annihilation by reactant island formation at the end of\nstretching and folding processes induced by turbulence. Statistics of\nprincipal curvature evolving in time, obtained using FPT, suggest that\nthese islands are ellipsoidal on average enclosing fresh reactants. Further\nexaminations show that the increase in *S*d is caused by the increased\nnegative curvature of the flame surface and eventual homogenization of\ntemperature gradients as these reactant islands shrink due to flame\npropagation and turbulent mixing. Finally, the evolution of the normalized,\naveraged, flame displacement speed vs. stretch Karlovitz number are found\nto collapse on a narrow band, suggesting that a unified description of\nflame speed dependence on stretch rate may be possible in the Lagrangian\ndescription.\n\n\n*Bio*:\nDr. Harshavardhana Urankar earned his PhD in Aerospace Engineering from\nIndian Institute of Science Bengaluru, specializing on turbulent reactive\nflows and numerical methods. Presently, he works at Siemens CT Research\nIndia as  Lead Research Engineer, where he carry out research for the\ndesign and development of ultra low emission, industrial gas turbine\ncombustors using Computational Fluid Dynamics. His research interests\ninclude: Direct Numerical Simulations and Large Eddy Simulations of\nturbulent and reactive flows, thermoacoustic instability, numerical\nmethods.\n\n*Participation from 2nd and 3rd year ME students is highly encouraged.*\n\nThank you,\nSincerely,\n-----\nDr. Shrikanth V.\nAssistant Professor\nDepartment of Mechanical Engineering,\nIndian Institute of Technology,\nDharwad - 580011\nEmail: vshrikanth@iidh.ac.in <vicchha86@gmail.com>\n","668":"Subject: The KPMG Innovation and Collaboration Challenge (KICC) 2019\nText: [image: KPMG Innovation and Collaboration Challenge (KICC) 2019]\n<https://sendy.dare2compete.com/l/r763aK3lA892t927sCdsC5eh763w/StFERNtBEn9PU7yR3aLofQ/ISOvzzUTo763Y8fW0iz10f2g>\n\nHello,\n\nTime has come to access your deep-seated wisdom and creativity to transform\nthe business ecosystem.\n\nThe KPMG Innovation and Collaboration Challenge (KICC) 2019\n<https://sendy.dare2compete.com/l/r763aK3lA892t927sCdsC5eh763w/StFERNtBEn9PU7yR3aLofQ/ISOvzzUTo763Y8fW0iz10f2g>\nis the ideal platform for interested students like you to connect with us\nearly in your pursuit of a successful career by exhibiting your ideation\nand presentation abilities on a global platform.\n\n*Eligibility:*\n\n   - You can sign up for KICC as a team of four members (comprising at\n   least one male and one female member).\n   - You and your team members should be pursuing a full-time\n   Undergraduate/Bachelor’s degree program with at least one year remaining of\n   your studies.\n   - At least one of you should be a student from Science, Technology,\n   Engineering or Mathematics field (Recommended).\n\n*Awards:*\n\n   - The winning team gets to represent India in the international finale\n   and potential candidates will be offered pre-placement opportunities with\n   KPMG in India.\n   - Winner will receive a cash prize of ₹1,00,000.\n   - Runners Up will receive a cash prize of ₹40,000.\n\n*Registration Deadline: *11:59 PM, 3rd November 2018\n\nFor more details visit https://d2c.pw/70691\nParticipate Now\n<https://sendy.dare2compete.com/l/r763aK3lA892t927sCdsC5eh763w/StFERNtBEn9PU7yR3aLofQ/ISOvzzUTo763Y8fW0iz10f2g>\n","669":"Subject: Fwd: [Fwd: Invitation to Students' Research Convention 2019 at IIT Kanpur]\nText: ---------- Forwarded message ---------\nFrom: Dean of Students' Affairs <dosa@iitk.ac.in>\nDate: Fri, Feb 1, 2019 at 11:07 AM\nSubject: [Fwd: Invitation to Students' Research Convention 2019 at IIT\nKanpur]\nTo: <deansa@admin.iitd.ac.in>, <dosw@iitr.ac.in>, <dost@iitm.ac.in>, <\ndeansa@hijli.iitkgp.ernet.in>, <dosa@iitk.ac.in>, <dos@iitg.ernet.in>, <\ndosa@iitbhu.ac.in>, <jmanjaly@iitgn.ac.in>, <deansa@iitrpr.ac.in>, <\nadean_academic@iitp.ac.in>, <dosa@iiti.ac.in>, <cstudents@iitj.ac.in>, <\ndean_academics@iith.ac.in>, <dean_students@iitmandi.ac.in>, <\ndeansa@iitbbs.ac.in>, <dean.sa@iitb.ac.in>, <prakharsharma371@gmail.com>, <\nsatyakn@iitp.ac.in>, <dsw@ismdhanbad.ac.in>, <prem@iith.ac.in>, <\nsachin@iitgoa.ac.in>, <sgupta@chemical.iitd.ac.in>, <svprabhu@iitdh.ac.in>\nCc: <arc_sg@iitk.ac.in>\n\n\nDear Colleague,\n\nGreetings.\n\nI request you to kindly forward the following mail to all the students of\nyour institute.\n\nThanks and regards\nShunmugaraj\nDean of Students' Affairs,\nIIT Kanpur\n\n\n---------------------------- Original Message ----------------------------\nFrom:    \"Academics and Research Cell, IIT Kanpur\" <arc_sg@iitk.ac.in>\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDear Sir/Madam,\n\nThe Academics and Research Cell (ARC), IIT Kanpur is organizing the very\nfirst *Students’ Research Convention (SRC)*, a 2-day-long multidisciplinary\nresearch conference in the month of March.

Vanka on 11th October\nText: Dear Colleagues and Students\n\nWe have a visitor, Dr. Sundaram Vanka, to the institute on 11th October. He\nwill be giving a talk on 11th October from 1400 to 1500 Hrs. The details of\nthe talk are as follows.\n\nTitle : Interference Management in Emerging Wireless Networks and Systems\n\nAbstract: An important source of complexity in emerging wireless networks\nis the increasingly diverse set of wireless devices and their applications.\nInterference management is a key challenge in the design and operation of\nsuch networks, and forms the overall theme that connects the speaker’s work\nin diverse settings. This talk provides a brief overview of some aspects of\nthis work and is organized as follows. Part one situates his work in the\noverall context of interference management and provides a bird’s eye view\nof his work both in academia and in industry. Parts two and three will\ndiscuss selected topics from his work in industry and as an academic\nresearcher, respectively. The talk concludes with some thoughts on the\nchallenges posed by the increased device heterogeneity expected in future\nwireless networks.\n\nThe talk will touch upon the speaker’s contributions to three challenging\nproblems in wireless LAN (WLAN, commonly called “Wi-Fi”) system design that\nform some of the core technology in flagship wireless LAN SoC products. The\nfirst two topics pertain to some of his work at  Broadcom on the general\nproblem of wireless coexistence, where devices with very different\ncommunication requirements and constraints share a common spectrum. The\nroles of interference avoidance, mitigation and adaptation are discussed in\nthe context of specific examples. It is pointed out how a holistic\nperspective on the system-level impact of interference is necessary for\nsignificantly improved coexistence. The third topic is selected to present\nsome of his work at Redpine Signals, Inc., that concerns the design of\nlow-complexity soft-output MIMO demodulators. It is shown how reasonably\naccurate Likelihood-Ratios (LLRs) can be obtained without the need for\nmatrix inversion when the number of spatial streams is small, a scenario of\npractical interest.\n\nAs part of his doctoral research, the speaker has worked on multiple\ntheoretical and experimental topics. One representative topic from each\nmethodology will be presented here. The experimental work will discuss the\ndevelopment of the first known prototype of a superposition coded wireless\nsystem that was implemented on a software radio platform. In addition to\nsystematically developing experimentally robust analogs and methodologies\nto theoretical constructs (such as the information-theoretic rate region),\nthis line of work also investigates some approaches that can leverage\nsuperposition coding in practice. The theoretical topic will discuss his\nwork on deriving asymptotic scaling laws for the convergence behavior for a\nclass of distributed signal processing algorithms called average consensus\nalgorithms when message exchange between network nodes occurs over an\ninterference-limited wireless network. By combining the mathematical tools\nfrom Markov chain theory, geometric random graph theory and information\ntheory, this line of work was the first to establish convergence results on\nthis algorithm in the presence of interference. In particular, it\nchallenges the long-held view that increased communication range always\nimproves the rate of convergence to consensus.\n\nThe talk ends with some thoughts on the emergence of device heterogeneity,\nand some challenges this poses in the context of the emerging Internet of\nThings (IoT).\n\nSpeaker bio: Sundaram Vanka received the B. Tech. and M. Tech. degrees from\nthe Indian Institute of Technology, Madras in 2003, and the Ph. D. degree\nfrom the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, United States of America in\n2012, all in Electrical Engineering. Since 2012 he has been with the\nwireless LAN (WLAN) systems architecture group at Broadcom Inc., a\nmarket-leading designer, developer and supplier of WLAN chips on diverse\nplatforms, where he is currently Principal R&D engineer in the systems\narchitecture group. He leads systems R&D efforts into new system\narchitectures and protocols for interference management and coexistences\nprotocols, and defines the technology roadmap for these technologies. His\nexpertise and charter spans the mathematical modeling, design,\nimplementation, laboratory characterization and productization of\nOFDM-based system design, interference-mitigation and coexistence protocols\nfor multiband/multichannel Wi-Fi and Wi-Fi/Bluetooth combo solutions. His\ndesigns form a critical part of Broadcom’s flagship WLAN/Bluetooth combo\nSystem-on-Chip (SoC) products that are shipped to leading consumer\nelectronics companies. His work has resulted in 15 US patents (7 granted, 8\npending).\n\nHis research interests lie in wireless communications and networking,\nspanning the mathematical modeling, simulation, design and prototyping of\nwireless systems and networks. He believes the coming Internet of Things\nopens up the possibility of re-evaluating some traditional assumptions\nabout wireless networks and offer new interesting topics for theoretical\nand as well as experimental investigation.\n\n--\nRegards,\nNaveen\n","704":"Subject: Non availability of Auditorium for next 4-5 Months\nText: Dear ALL,\nRenovation of civil work is started in Auditorium .

Venkata Sathish Akella*\n               Senior Scientist (Project), Department of Applied Mechanics,\nIIT Madras\n\nDate.     : *14 November 2018 (Wednesday)*\n\nTime.     : *2:30 to 3:30 PM*\n\nVenue.   : *Room No. 119*\n\nTitle: *Self-propulsion by Marangoni forces*\n\n*Abstract:* We experimentally study the self-propulsion of particles/drops\ninduced by surface tension gradients also known as Marangoni forces. In the\nfirst part of the talk, we report experiments on an agarose gel tablet\nloaded with camphoric acid (c-boat) spontaneously set into motion by\nsurface tension gradients on the water surface. We observe three distinct\nmodes of c-boat motion: harmonic mode where the c-boat speed oscillates\nsinusoidally in time, a steady mode where the c-boat maintains constant\nspeed, and an intermittent mode where the c-boat maintains near-zero speed\nbetween sudden jumps in speed. Whereas all three modes have been separately\nreported before in different systems, controlled release of camphoric acid\nfrom the agarose gel matrix allowed the observation of all the three modes\nin the same system. In the second part, we report self-propulsion of liquid\ndrops on a liquid surface. The dynamics involved are quite rich in\ncomparison to that of a particle on liquid surface as a liquid drop\nexhibits motion, deformation and break up. In this regard, we\nexperimentally study the motion of an Octanoic Acid drop on aqueous\nsolutions of octanoic acid. In the current work, we study a regime where\ntriple line undulations result in varying Marangoni propulsion and a random\nwalking drop. We discuss two parametric regimes where the drop motion\nexhibits a Levy walk and a near-Gaussian random walk. We present mean\nsquared displacement, probability distributions of step lengths as well as\nfrom velocity auto-correlations from observations of the drop motion as\nevidence. Finally, we show that the drop `foraging' mimics a living system.\n\n*Brief Biodata (Sic):* My primary interest is in the area of Soft Condensed\nMatter Physics. I finished my Ph.D. in Physics from Brandeis University,\n USA, in Sep 2013. At Brandeis, I worked on nucleation kinetics of protein\ncrystallization (Advisor: Prof. Seth Fraden). I have been a post-doctoral\nscholar with Prof. Mahesh Panchagnula at IIT Madras since Mar 2017. Before\nthat, I was a post-doctoral scholar with Prof. Mahesh M.

According to research,\nclose to *90 percent *of significant illnesses are related to high-stress\nlevels. So how can you avoid such illnesses? Start by spotting these early\nsigns.\n[image: unable to focus]\n*1. You're just not able to focus*\nWhen you've to deal with a truckload of work while balancing your other\ncommitments, life can get overwhelming. It is exactly at this point, your\nbody starts secreting cortisol, and as per research, prolonged exposure to\ncortisol might lead to shrinking of the hippocampus, your brain's memory\ncenter. All of this will culminate in you feeling distracted a lot.\n[image: falling sick]\n*2. You fall sick quite often*\nEver wondered why as weeks and days go by you seem to be catching cold, or\ncoughing a lot, or even feeling a little feverish. Well, it's not just the\nchanging weather around you, it could well be the stress you're going\nthrough. When you're stressed, your body secretes a stress hormone called\ncortisol, though they're helpful in the short-term when they're withdrawn\nfrom your system as days pass by, your body becomes more susceptible to\nsickness.\n[image: hazy memory]\n*3. Your memory is a little hazy*\nHave you misplaced your keys quite a few times this week? Or have you found\nyourself forgetting a word while speaking? Poor memory recall has often\nbeen linked to excessive stress. In fact, research shows that stress can\nreduce spatial memory, that part of your brain, which helps you locate\nobjects and other seemingly ordinary day-to-day things.\n[image: too thirsty]\n*4. You feel extremely thirsty*\nWhen you get a little anxious, it causes your adrenal glands to secrete out\nstress hormones into your body. This leads to a fluctuation in other\nhormones, too, which go on to affect the fluid levels in your body. So if\nyou’re feeling thirsty reading this right now, maybe you're stressed out,\nand you need to relax first before grabbing that bottle of water.\n[image: sleepless]\n*5. You are not able to get a good night's sleep*\nIf you find yourself waking up in the middle of the night or catch yourself\nworrying or thinking about things that haven't happened yet, it could be a\nsign of anxiety. After a long day filled with intellect engaging work,\nsleep should come naturally to you, but if you feel tired and find it\ndifficult to fall asleep, it’s possible that your stress levels are high.\n\n*Looking for tips to de-stress?

STEPS Challenge! for ISCA INTERSPEECH-2019*\n\n*HISTORY:* On July 20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC, Earth witnessed one of the most\nchallenging technology accomplishments by mankind to date of NASA Apollo-11\nwith over 600M people witnessing both the landing and first steps on the\nmoon by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. Next July 2019 marks the 50th\nAnniversary of the historic Apollo-11 lunar landing and first steps.\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11\n\n*NSF CRSS-UTDallas Project:* With support from the US National Science\nFoundation (NSF-CISE), CRSS-UTDallas has spent the last six years\ndeveloping a hardware/software solution to digitize and recover all\n30-track analog tapes from Apollo-11 (plus Apollo-13 and other missions),\nas well as development of speech diarization technologies to advance speech\ntechnology for such data. A total of 19,000 hours of data consisting of all\nNASA air-to-ground, mission control, and backroom support team discussions\nwas released this year (news releases from this NSF sponsored project this\nyear include: NSF, NASA, BBC, AIP (Acoustical Society of America), NPR,\nmany online news sites, and involvement in a planned CNN documentary where\nthis data is contributing, etc.). To date, this will be the largest\npublically available audio corpus of time synchronized, team-based (~600\npeople) naturalistic communications to accomplish a real-world task.\n\n*ANNOUNCEMENT:* This email is to announce the Official Opening and Release\nof the *FEARLESS STEPS CHALLENGE* corpus, which is being shared for a\nSpecial Session at ISCA INTERSPEECH-2019. The attached Challenge\nRelease details\nthe 5 challenge tasks involved:\n\n1. *SAD*: Speech Activity Detection\n\n2. *SD*: Speaker Diarization\n\n3. *SID*: Speaker Identification\n\n4. *ASR*: Automatic Speech Recognition\n\n5. *SENTIMENT*: Sentiment Detection\n\n\n\nThis challenge corpus consists of 100hours from 5 of the 30-track channels\nspanning three phases of Apollo-11 mission: (i) Lift Off, (ii) Lunar\nLanding, (iii) Lunar Walk. All data for this challenge *is now available\nvia a download option* for all to participate (this site has sample audio\nfrom the NSF funded project: <https://app.exploreapollo.org/>\nhttp://fearlesssteps.exploreapollo.org/ ). In addition, any lab/group\nwishing to have access to the entire 19,000 hours can do so without charge\n(this is public data, so it will be available via download, or a small fee\nfor a hard-disk and shipping to your lab).\n\nWhile diarization efforts in the past have concentrated on single channel\nbroadcast news, interviews, etc. These all represent typically a single\nspeaker, or small group discussing topics of interest. The *FEARLESS STEPS\nCORPUS* is all time synchronized (with IRIG Time Channel) across 30\nchannels, with loops containing anywhere from 3-33 speakers working\ncollaboratively to solve challenging problems. CRSS-UTDallas has produced\nfull diarization output for the entire 19,000hrs of data (SAD, SID,\nDIAR/ASR) which is available with the corpus.\n\n*REQUEST:*  Please visit the website and register for participating in this\nhistorical 50th Anniversary Special Session at ISCA INTERSPEECH-2019. If\nyou have interest in getting access to the *FEARLESS STEPS CORPUS* and\npotentially participating in the CHALLENGE, *please register and download\nthe corpus! *\n\n*NOTE:* All updates to the Data and Evaluation Plan will be updated on\nthe Fearless\nSteps Challenge <http://fearlesssteps.exploreapollo.org/> Website\n\nMany thanks for your interest!\n\nRegards,\n\n\n\n*Fearless Steps Team,*\n\n*Center for Robust Speech Speech Systems (CRSS)*\n\n\n*Robust Speech Technologies Lab (RSTL) *\n\n*The University of Texas at Dallas *\n","759":"Subject: Mid semester examination timetable - Spring 2018-19\nText: Dear All,\n\nPlease find an enclosed pdf file of the Mid-semester examination timetable\n- Spring 2018-19.\n\nThanking You.\n\nRegards,\nAcademic Section\n","760":"Subject: Fwd: Summer School @ IIIT Bangalore\nText: wbw\nPrasanna\n----\nS.

Please let me\nknow if anyone in your circle is interested.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are organizing a summer workshop (hands on) in the broad area of Deep\nlearning, neural signal processing and robotics during June 10-16.  The\nworkshop will be hosted in IISc at the Department of Electronic Systems\nEngineering.\n\n\n\nWe have identified the following three themes as the main focus of the\nworkshop\n\n\n\na. EEG based processing of Audio Signals with BCI applications\n\nb. Developing Deep learning algorithms for Robotics platform\n\nc. Embedded systems and Neuromorphic Sensors\n\n\n\nEach of the themes will have at least two faculty mentors and up to 20\nstudents working on the theme for a week at IISc.\n\n\n\nIn this regard, I am pleased to invite you working in one of the areas. The\nfiner details of the work are flexible and will be finalized based on the\nmutual interest of the team.\n\n\n\nThe workshop is loosely modelled in line with the JHU/Telluride workshop\nwhere we will get an initial work started on a chosen research theme. This\ncan then progress after the workshop and become a long term collaborative\neffort. The workshop will also feature daily talks from experts in this\nbroad field of Neuromorphic computing.\n\n\n\nThe workshop organization will take care of the transportation (including\nairfare) and lodging at IISc (for all attendees) during the period of\nworkshop. Also, all facilities including cloud computing, EEG recording\nsetup, data set necessary for processing, would be made available during\nthe workshop. This workshop is supported by generous funds from Broadcom\nInc.\n\n\n\nPlease let us know your availability for the workshop. We look forward to\nhosting you here at IISc for this hands on workshop.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nChetan\n\nAssistant Professor, IISc\n","769":"Subject: End of the line\nText: I hope you guys had fun solving our small cryptographic trail.

Financial support will be provided by the co-advisors through their\nprojects or\nconsultancies, or a center of excellence at IIT Delhi.

The\ninteraction of femtosecond laser pulse with magnetic material triggers\ntransfer of energy from the electrons into spin and lattice systems. The\ndevelopments in various time-resolved pump-probe techniques allowed us to\nexplore such interactions between these reservoirs, in metals, that occur\nat sub-picosecond to picosecond timescales. Investigating the interactions\nat ultrashort timescales is a key to obtain control over many phenomena\nsuch as ultrafast demagnetization, laser-induced magnetization reversal\n(all-optical switching), super-diffusive spin-transport, and even\nlaser-induced magnetic phase-transition. My research goal is to explore\nmechanisms involving the aforementioned phenomena in advanced magnetic\nmaterials suitable for energy efficient spintronic technologies operating\nat terahertz (THz) frequencies.\n\nIn my talk, I will address potential mechanisms involving the helicity\n(circular polarization)-independent and helicity-dependent all-optical\nswitching (AOS) processes in both ferrimagnetic GdFeCo and ferromagnetic\nCo/Pt thin film systems. It has been demonstrated, in metallic magnets,\nthat the loss of spin ordering to the laser excitation, i.e., ultrafast\ndemagnetization triggers a flow of spin-polarized current oscillating at\nterahertz frequencies, which will eventually be converted to THz charge\ncurrent when a heavy metal layer is placed next to the magnetic layer. I\nwill present the laser-driven THz-signals, in Co/Pt bilayers, and their\nsensitivity to varied roughness, crystal structure, and intermixing at the\ninterface. Finally, I will discuss the timescales of laser-induced\nphase-transition from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase in FeRh.\nExcitation of antiferromagnetic FeRh/Pt bilayer by femtosecond laser pulses\nresults in an efficient emission of nearly single cycle THz pulse being an\nevidence for laser-induced changes of the magnetization in FeRh. The study\nbased on double pump THz-emission spectroscopy technique reveals that the\nlaser-induced phase-transition emerges at sub-nanosecond timescale, the\nspeed that yields a further control over phase-transition by means of both\ntemperature and applied magnetic field.\n\n*Succinct information about the speaker: *Dr. Rajasekhar Medapalli is a\npostdoctoral researcher at the Center for Memory and Recording Research,\nUniversity of California San Diego. His research mainly focuses on the\nall-optical control of (magnetic-)materials at nanometer length scales. He\nalso fabricates rare-earth thin films based spintronic devices suitable for\nterahertz spintronics.Dr. Medapalli received his Ph.D. in Physics from\nRadboud University Nijmegen in 2014 focusing on efficient optical control\nof magnetization dynamics in metallic alloys. Prior to this, he received\nhis M.Tech degree (Nanotechnology) from Amity University in 2009 and M.Sc\ndegree (Physics) from Andhra University in 2007.\n\n*****************************************************************\n\nALL ARE WELCOME.\n\nThanking you.\n\nYours truly,\nR.

To realize\nan economically-independent, environmentally-sustainable and socially-\nresponsible future\nrequires the support of technically-sound, scientifically-rigorous and\ncontextually-relevant solutions. This is where the role of design thinking\nbecomes pivotal.\nDesign as ‘planning for change’ is the engine for innovation in all forms.\nIt cuts across all facets of the innovation ecosystem and connects them\ntogether.\nIt is a knowledge-intensive activity that spans both\nproblem-finding-and-formulation and problem solving to ensure development\nof feasible solutions that contextually fulfil functionality and improve\nthe quality of life.\n\nDesign Thinking is frequently analogized to business today. It is important\nto recognize that Design Thinking is not exclusive to designers or\nunattainable to those in another discipline. Design Thinking is an approach\nto inquiry and expression that complements and enhances existing skills,\nbehaviors and techniques.\nLeaders are looking to find something new to grasp onto in order to make\nsense of what’s going on and to prepare for a future of unprecedented\nuncertainties.\n\nThe talk would expose the students to basics of Design Thinking and would\nhave some hands-on experience to understand design thinking better,\nwhich would help participants shape their career better.\n\n*Speaker Bio:*\nProfessor Bhavin Kothari is Senior Faculty with Strategic Design Management\ndiscipline at National Institute of Design (NID).

We allow only 1 restart at the time of event but you will incur the\npenalty as mentioned in the rules.\n3. The communications are allowed in so far as the microcontroller may not\nbe able to store the entirety of your code. In such a case you are allowed\nto run the code on your laptops/phones or any such external devices via the\nBluetooth and/or WiFi. The robot is supposed to be completely autonomous. *You\ncannot manually control the robot during the event.* Any such control will\nlead to disqualification of the team.\nYou will be allowed unrestrained access to the maze from 10th October\nonwards so far as you do not damage it. So you may practice for all the\npossible scenarios.\n4. The starting position and orientations will be determined on the spot\nand will be identical for all the teams.

All the tender conditions were explained to the prospective bidders and\ntheir questions were also answered if they required some clarification.\n2. Provisions regarding rules & regulations, fines, menu, and other\nrequirements, along with the functioning of the mess, were explained in\ndetail.\n3.

Awareness, though not necessarily mastery,\nof basis notions in linear algebra would be helpful. For example, what is a\nlinear transformation? What is a basis of a vector space?\n\nI intend to begin with the Greeks :), namely that why \\sqrt{2} is not\nrational, then proceed to discuss the Dedekind's construction of so called\n'real' numbers. From there we proceed to study the notions of convergence,\nderivative, and integral. Later on we proceed to study the notion of\nRiemann integral, its limitations, and its usage in the theory of Fourier\nseries (elementary). We will study Cauchy integral and its generalisation\nas the notion of differential form.  These topics constitute the first\nthree books of Godement's analysis.  I believe it takes at least 6 months\nto go over all these concepts.\n\nI want to emphasise that this so called 'course on analysis' (*which is not\nan official course--  no credits, no tests, no assignments) *is not about\nlearning various techniques in mathematical analysis ( though that comes as\nbonus). It is about how various notions like convergence, derivative arise\nnaturally, and how they force one to perceive the already defined notions\nin a much more general framework.\n\nTo continue with the previous paragraph, we will look into the fourth\nvolume of Godement's analysis. It takes at least 6 months to go through\nthis volume. The first three volumes takes 6 months though. This is because\nthe fourth volume is highly technical, containing the Lebesgue's notion of\nan integral, studying which leads us to consider symmetric spaces, locally\ncompact groups, etc. Finally in the last chapter of the book, we see the\nculmination of all the techniques learned until then, in the theory of\nmodular forms, L functions, and automorphic forms; these later topics\nconstitute current research in number theory.\n\nThe entire journey takes at least one year, and I believe it is worth\ntaking at least once in a life time. We will be able to see the importance\nof coming up with the right definition in solving a mathematical problem,\nin addition to learning various techniques to solve several classical\nproblems in mathematics.\n\n\nKishore\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Jun 20, 2019 at 10:18 AM Sushma Biradar <170010032@iitdh.ac.in>\nwrote:\n\n> Respected sir\n>\n> Could you please tell what all topics will be covered in the course ?\n> Also, what are the prerequisites for the course ?\n>\n> Thank you\n> Yours sincerely\n> Sushma\n>\n> On Wed, Jun 19, 2019 at 11:24 AM Kishore <kishore@iitdh.ac.in> wrote:\n>\n>> Dear all,\n>>\n>> (I am Kishore, an assistant professor in the Math. department).

Put on those running shoes, go for a\n> walk or play a few rounds of your favourite sport, or swim for a while.\n> Exercise has some direct stress-busting benefits and regulates emotions.\n> *5. No Showers*\n> Well, let's be honest, a lot of us can admit that we're guilty of skipping\n> showers. The fact is that a quick shower will make you feel less drowsy and\n> lethargic.

The\n> interaction of femtosecond laser pulse with magnetic material triggers\n> transfer of energy from the electrons into spin and lattice systems. The\n> developments in various time-resolved pump-probe techniques allowed us to\n> explore such interactions between these reservoirs, in metals, that occur\n> at sub-picosecond to picosecond timescales. Investigating the interactions\n> at ultrashort timescales is a key to obtain control over many phenomena\n> such as ultrafast demagnetization, laser-induced magnetization reversal\n> (all-optical switching), super-diffusive spin-transport, and even\n> laser-induced magnetic phase-transition. My research goal is to explore\n> mechanisms involving the aforementioned phenomena in advanced magnetic\n> materials suitable for energy efficient spintronic technologies operating\n> at terahertz (THz) frequencies.\n>\n> In my talk, I will address potential mechanisms involving the helicity\n> (circular polarization)-independent and helicity-dependent all-optical\n> switching (AOS) processes in both ferrimagnetic GdFeCo and ferromagnetic\n> Co/Pt thin film systems. It has been demonstrated, in metallic magnets,\n> that the loss of spin ordering to the laser excitation, i.e., ultrafast\n> demagnetization triggers a flow of spin-polarized current oscillating at\n> terahertz frequencies, which will eventually be converted to THz charge\n> current when a heavy metal layer is placed next to the magnetic layer. I\n> will present the laser-driven THz-signals, in Co/Pt bilayers, and their\n> sensitivity to varied roughness, crystal structure, and intermixing at the\n> interface. Finally, I will discuss the timescales of laser-induced\n> phase-transition from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic phase in FeRh.\n> Excitation of antiferromagnetic FeRh/Pt bilayer by femtosecond laser pulses\n> results in an efficient emission of nearly single cycle THz pulse being an\n> evidence for laser-induced changes of the magnetization in FeRh. The study\n> based on double pump THz-emission spectroscopy technique reveals that the\n> laser-induced phase-transition emerges at sub-nanosecond timescale, the\n> speed that yields a further control over phase-transition by means of both\n> temperature and applied magnetic field.\n>\n> *Succinct information about the speaker: *Dr. Rajasekhar Medapalli is a\n> postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Memory and Recording Research,\n> University of California San Diego. His research mainly focuses on the\n> all-optical control of (magnetic-)materials at nanometer length scales. He\n> also fabricates rare-earth thin films based spintronic devices suitable for\n> terahertz spintronics.Dr. Medapalli received his Ph.D. in Physics from\n> Radboud University Nijmegen in 2014 focusing on efficient optical control\n> of magnetization dynamics in metallic alloys. Prior to this, he received\n> his M.Tech degree (Nanotechnology) from Amity University in 2009 and M.Sc\n> degree (Physics) from Andhra University in 2007.\n>\n> *****************************************************************\n>\n> ALL ARE WELCOME.\n>\n> Thanking you.\n>\n> Yours truly,\n> R.

It acts as a buffer for such students and provides them with an\nopportunity to stay in IIT for completion of their degree.\nEntry to ARP: The ARPC convenes a meeting to assess the performances of\nacademically weak students and the need for putting a particular student\nunder ARP is analyzed. Thereafter, the transition from regular student to\nARP has to begin with a meeting of the students and their parents/guardians\nwith the committee overseeing the performance of such students. This\nmeeting must emphasize the seriousness of the situation to the students and\ntheir guardians. *5 active backlogs (FR's+DX's+XX's) for first and second\nyear students, and 7 active backlogs(FR's+DX's+XX's) for subsequent year\nstudents are the usual numbers that will put a student in ARP.*\nThe fee requirements are also the same as that for a normal student.\nHowever, an ARP Student must contact the respective professors of his/her\ncourses personally for grades and then the professors will forward the\ngrades to the Academic Section. No paper record otherwise exists for the\ngrades.\n\nMentoring and Monitoring in the initial few years the responsibility of\nmentoring and monitoring the ARP students have been undertaken by the ARPC.\nDuring the course of his stay in ARP, the student works in close\ncoordination with a faculty member. An ARP student can register for roughly\n24 credits for the semester. The credits could be more or less depending\nupon the ARP Faculty Coordinator. In order to get the basics clear, an ARP\nstudent may take up the courses which he/she has already cleared in his\nprevious semesters. However, no extra credits/improvisation are provided\nfor such courses.\n\nExit from ARP: The ARPC convenes a meeting and treats individual cases in\nterms of the report from the faculty coordinator, report of the department\nmentor, and the performance of the student in the semester are evaluated\nand a decision is taken based on these criteria. If the students perform\nwell in his ARP time, he is transferred back to the normal curriculum load.\nIn very few cases, if the student fails to perform in ARP, he/she is\nrecommended to take termination from the institute\n\n-- \nAcademic Office\nIIT Dharwad\n","1139":"Subject: Regarding Exams, Preparation and Available Support\nText: Dear Students,\n\nWe are almost at the end of the semester, and you must all be running\naround now, or may be sitting at a go for hours, trying to find the perfect\nnotes, for the end-sems  that are around the corner.\n\nI can imagine that it might be a stressful time for you, and some of you\nmight find it difficult to cope with all the pressure.\n\nJust remember that you're not alone in this and that we're always here to\nhelp and support you.\n\nA wise man named Fred Rogers once said, “*In times of stress, the best\nthing we can do for each other is to listen with our ears and our hearts\nand to be assured that our questions are just as important as our answers*\n.”\n\nI would like to remind you that there are *experts *out there who can do a\ntremendous job at listening to your problems for free through *YourDOST.*\nThere are three ways you can go about it:\n\n1.

Since nobody wants to fall prey to\na phishing scam, I would like to share you some basic information and\nguidelines in keeping yourself safe.\n\n\n\n*Phishing* is a fraudulent attempt to obtain sensitive information such as\nusernames, passwords, and other personal details by disguising as a\ntrustworthy entity in electronic communication. Typically carried out\nby email spoofing or instant messaging, it often directs users to enter\npersonal information at a fake website, the look and feel of which are\nidentical to the legitimate site. Users are often lured by communications\npurporting to be from trusted parties. Thus everyone should be very careful\nwhile using the internet and accessing emails in your inbox.\n\n\n\n*Instructions to Avoid Phishing Scams*\n\n\n\n   - Do not disclose your *E-Mail*/*LDAP* login credentials to anyone (ie:\n   - *Username* & *Password*).\n   - Do not enter your login credentials on any unknown websites.\n   - Do not enter login credentials in any anonymous pop-up windows.\n   - Do not readily click on links in emails from unknown sources -\n   Instead, roll your mouse pointer over the link to reveal its true\n   destination, displayed in the bottom left corner of your screen. Beware if\n   this is different from what is displayed in the text of the link from the\n   email.\n   - Do not copy an unknown link from these kinds of spam emails and paste\n   them on your web browsers - These links are made to look very humble by the\n   phishers but they will actually land you to some scam and fraud sites.\n   - Be careful about opening or saving any document or attachment that\n   come with spam emails - Do not trust these kinds of emails even if they\n   appear to be sent by some authorized entity.\n   - Never ever send your confidential information about your account in an\n   email.\n   - Do not respond to emails from unknown sources. Check junk mail folders\n   regularly in case a legitimate email gets through by mistake.\n   - Do not open or forward emails which you suspect as being scams.\n   - Keep your browser up to date – Security patches are released for\n   popular browsers, in response to the security loopholes that phishers\n   and other hackers inevitably discover and exploit.\n   - Please report immediately on *ccsop@iitdh.ac.in <ccsop@iitdh.ac.in>* if\n   you receive any such email.\n   - Immediately change your passwords if you have accidentally revealed\n   your credentials.\n   - *CCS Operator* do not send any such emails to our user community.\n\n\n\n*A Phishing email typically looks similar to the below one:-*\n\n*________________________________________*\nFrom: support@iitdh.ac.in\nSent: Thu, Mar 15, 2019\nSubject: UPGRADE EMAIL ACCOUNT\nWe are currently upgrading our Server for our Account Holders. In order to\nupgrade your account, you need to assist us by sending the information\nbelow or else your Account might be lost.\nProvide the below information :\nUser Name :\nPass Word :\nRegards,\nADMIN, IIT Dharwad\n*________________________________________*\n\n\n\nPlease note that the email cited above is a spurious one, trying to get\nyour email credentials so that the same can be used to get access to your\nemail account. Even the Sender's  Email ID may appear to be originating\nfrom IITDH, please do not respond to any such email as it is a phishing\nattempt made by an external entity. *You are requested to ignore all such\nemails without responding to them as they are fraudulent attempts **by\nPHISHERS & other HACKERS **to steal your password so as to be able to hack\ninto your email account.*\n\n\n\nThanks and Regards..!\n\n\n\nVince Vincent M\n\nExecutive Technical Assistant ,\nComputer Center , IIT Dharwad .\n","1167":"Subject: Re: Hockey Club\nText: The deadline is 4:30 PM today NOT 9:00 PM.

The\nalternatives to ICEs and conventional fuels start from a very low base and\nface significant environmental and other barriers to fast and unrestrained\ngrowth. For instance, there is speculation that transport could be rapidly\nand fully electrified.  However commercial transport, which accounts for\nover 50% of transport energy use, is very difficult or impossible to\nelectrify. To replace even all light duty vehicles (LDVs) by battery\nelectric vehicles (BEVs) requires the numbers of BEVs to increase by\nperhaps a thousand-fold on a global scale. The greenhouse gas (GHG) impact\nof BEVs would be worse than that of conventional vehicles if electricity\ngeneration and the energy used for battery production are not sufficiently\ndecarbonized. If coal continues to be a part of the energy mix, as it will\nin China and India, and if power generation is near urban centres, even\nlocal air quality in terms of particulates, nitrogen oxides and sulphur\ndioxide would get worse. The human toxicity impacts associated with battery\nproduction are large and cannot be ignored as they currently are. If\ngovernments wish to force a change to BEVs, very large investments in\ncharging infrastructure and electricity generation will be needed. There\nwill be additional costs in the short term associated with various\nsubsidies required to promote such a change and in the longer term, the\nloss of revenue from fuel taxes which contribute significantly to public\nfinances in most countries.  Internal combustion engines will continue to\npower transport, particularly commercial transport, to a very large degree\nfor decades to come and will continue to improve. There will also be a role\nfor low-carbon and other alternative fuels where they make sense. However,\nsuch alternatives also start from a low base and face constraints on rapid\nand unlimited growth so that they are not expected to make up much more\nthan 10% of the total transport energy demand by 2040. In the longer term,\nas GHG-free electricity generation is greatly expanded and battery\ntechnology improves there will be an increasing role for BEVs and the\nrequired charging and recycling infrastructure will evolve. Meanwhile,\nthere will certainly be increasing electrification, particularly of LDVs in\nthe form of hybridization to improve ICEs.\n\n*Bio*:\nGautam Kalghatgi is currently a Visiting Professor at Oxford University\n(Engineering Science) and also at Imperial College London (Mechanical\nEngineering)\nand in the past, at KTH Stockholm, TU Eindhoven and Sheffield University.\nHe is a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering, SAE (Society of\nAutomotive\nEngineers), I.Mech.E. and the Combustion Institute and an Honorary Fellow\nof the International Society for Energy Environment and Sustainability.\nHe worked for 31 years at Shell Research followed by 8 years in Saudi\nAramco before retiring in June 2018.

It is even more so when the product, as in the robotics domain,\nis multi-disciplinary in nature and entails diverse skill sets across\ndesign, development, manufacturing, sales and service. Problem solving\nskills that need to be developed beyond the classroom to address real-world\nissues will be illustrated with a few case studies across multiple\ndisciplines. At a higher level the fundamentals in our eco-system that\nimpede the full intellectual potential of India to be leveraged to realize\nglobally competitive products can be debated.\n\nShort biography of the speaker:\nDr. Jagannath Raju is the Chief Technology Officer of Systemantics, and is\nresponsible for the company’s product development and technology strategy.\nHe incubates product ideas based on market requirements and leads their\ndevelopment into full-fledged products. His consulting experience in the\nUSA covers development of innovative robotic systems for space, underwater\nand hazardous applications for projects funded by NASA, Federal Sea Grant\nProgram, Department of Energy and the National Science Foundation. He also\nserved as a consultant in the Boston area to many companies involved in\nrobotics and automation R&D, especially in semiconductor fabrication and\nhandling, and was a visiting scientist at the Mechanical Engineering\nLaboratory, Tsukuba, Japan under a fellowship from Japan’s Ministry of\nInternational Trade and Industry.\n\nAfter relocating back to India in 1994 he worked as a consultant to the\nCenter for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, Bangalore for the\ndevelopment of a controller for a robotic inspection platform before\nfounding Systemantics in 1995. His expertise covers many areas of\ntechnology relevant to robotic systems, viz., mechanical design, actuator\nand sensors, computer control, signal and power electronics and embedded\nand application software.

For all induced\nsubgraphs H of G the absolute difference between the chromatic number χ(H)\nand the colors used by c to color H is calculated. The maximum of the\ndifferences is denoted by φ_c(G). The chromatic discrepancy, denoted by\nφ(G), of a graph G is defined to be the minimum φ_c(G), over all proper\ncolorings c of G. If H is restricted to only connected induced subgraphs,\nwe denote the parameter by φ̂(G). These parameters, which have potential\napplications in channel allocation problems in wireless networks, have been\nintroduced by Arvind et. al. (Discrete Applied mathematics, 2015). We\nsurvey some results and raise a few open problems on chromatic discrepancy\nof graphs.Let H be any induced subgraph of a given Graph G. If we\ncomplement H, the new graph obtained from G is called a partial complement\nof G. We ask the question: for a given graph G and a property Π, is there a\npartial complement of G which satisfies theproperty Π? This problem has\nbeen studied recently by Fomin et. al. (SWAT 2018). We obtain that if the\nproperty Π is 'cluster' (disjoint union of cliques), then the problem can\nbe solved in polynomial-time. We also obtain that if the property Π is\n'H-free' (without any induced copy of H), then there exists a graph which\ndoes not have a partial complement satisfying Π. *\n\nThanks and Regards,\nSandeep\n\n-- \nSandeep R.

New Year, a time when most of us ambitiously resolve to take on a new\nhabit and potentially sustain it for the duration of the year. Habits like\n- waking up early, maybe finally hitting the gym, or cooking dinner on our\nown etc. *Unfortunately, only 8%  of us manage to stick with these habits.*\n\nBut worry not, with the following 3 tips, your habits will have no choice\nbut to stick like Fevikwik:\n\n*1. 5...4...3...2...1...GO!*\n\n“I’ll just spend the first week as my last week of fun, and then start the\nMonday after.” NO! Don’t do it. Start from day 1. When you feel yourself\nhesitate, follow the 5 second rule by Mel Robbins - *Count 5-4-3-2-1 and\nMOVE PHYSICALLY*. The window between deciding to take an action and your\nmind killing it is 5 seconds. This trick will make sure that you\nsuccessfully get through this window and act.\n\nSo go get ‘em!\n\n*2. Nano-habits*\n\nA major habit change can seem like a daunting task. But did anyone set in\nstone that you need to go all in from day 1? No, not really. So how about\nyou take baby steps, and then gradually climb your way up?\n\nFor eg. You want to wake up earlier. Start with setting your alarm 10 mins\nearlier than usual, and then month by month increase this interval. Next,\nmaybe stop using your phone an hour before going to sleep as phones are\nknown to affect our sleep cycle. You’ll start noticing the difference very\nsoon!\n\nRemember, a 1% change (through Nano-Habits) you make each day can result in\na 37 times better you by the end of the year. (1.01^365 = 37.8)\n\n*3. The 2-minute Rule*\n\nA major and natural stumbling block to bringing a change in life is\nlaziness. For eg. You have decided to hit the gym, but then you wake up and\nthink about changing into your workout outfit, and laziness takes over like\na heavy weight.\n\nThe two minute rule dictates that if you can reduce the time taken to\npractice a habit by 2-min, the chances of practicing the same would\nincrease multi-fold. So, go to sleep in your workout clothes with your\nshoes right by your bed.\n\nThe reverse applies to the habits you want to cut down on - delay them by\n2-minutes. For eg. To reduce binge watching your TV, remove the batteries\nfrom the remote and place them in a different room. This is a very powerful\ntool to build on your good habits and cut down on your bad ones.\n\n*It's 2019! This year, let's show your mind who's the boss. Just follow\nthese rules religiously and there's no looking back*\n\n*Looking for more such tips or motivation?

MEMS accelerometers are widely used in various motion\nsensing applications including medical, industrial, and military where\nmeasurement of acceleration, vibration, etc is required. Most of these\nsensors depend on capacitive sensing techniques for monitoring the\ndisplacement of moving elements. In this work, we introduce a novel sensing\nscheme utilizing a laterally movable gate field effect transistor (LMGFET).\nLateral motion of the FET gate results in a change in channel width. This\nresults in a change in channel current that, in principle, is linearly\nproportional to mechanical motion/ acceleration. The device can be used to\ndetect milli-g range of acceleration. The sensor has high sensitivity, low\ncross-axis sensitivity and excellent linearity.

Let me explain. I had joined my college about 5\n> months back. My parents expected me to be studious and get placed into a\n> top company with ideally a 7 figure salary. So, I would study hard, even at\n> the cost of being made fun of and bullied. But I also made sure that I\n> socialised, made friends, and pursued a sport.\n> A semester went by. I was at home for the sem break when my exam results\n> were announced. I had scored a 8.75 GPA. It was decent, or so I thought.\n> Then my parents saw it and suddenly it felt like someone had died in the\n> house.“You have brought shame to the family”, my dad said. My heart sank. I\n> was in the top 20 of my class, and here I was being treated like a failure\n> by my own parents.\n> For the next 1 year, my parents would check up on me at least 5 times in a\n> day. If I didn’t answer my phone, they'd call my roommate. If I was out\n> with friends, I would get yelled at for throwing away my life. I wasn’t\n> allowed to have fun anymore. I slipped into depression, skipping classes,\n> meals, and even socialising. My self-confidence and self-esteem hit\n> rock-bottom. I had no idea what to do, and had to finally consider the idea\n> of counseling.\n> But I wasn’t ready to meet with a counselor in person. That’s when I came\n> across a poster on my campus about an online counseling portal. I decided\n> to give it a shot. I got onto the portal, and was connected with Ruchi.\n> Will she judge me?”, “How can she ever help me?”, “This is a bad idea”,\n> were some of the thoughts running in my head. But Ruchi made me feel so\n> comfortable. I can tell you that with her, I got exactly what I needed,\n> compassion, empathy, guidance and a patient ear, without even a tinge of\n> judgement.\n> As I got more comfortable with her, I took her suggestion and we moved to\n> sessions over Skype. At her request, I asked my parents to speak with her.\n> At first, they were angry. “Why do you need counseling?” “What mistakes did\n> we ever make to see this day?”, they said. But on my repeated pleadings,\n> they gave in. The change in their behaviour was miraculous. It was like I\n> had lost my parents and had now found them again. 3 months later, I emerged\n> from counseling with renewed vigour, confidence, and self-worth. Most\n> importantly, I felt hope - hope that I could be happy again.\n> In July 2018, I joined my first job in one of the world’s foremost\n> consultancy firms with a 7 figure salary. In the end, I just have one thing\n> to say, neither is counseling something to be scared of, nor is it\n> something to be ashamed of.\n> Got something on your mind that’s troubling you?

Parts two and three will\n> discuss selected topics from his work in industry and as an academic\n> researcher, respectively. The talk concludes with some thoughts on the\n> challenges posed by the increased device heterogeneity expected in future\n> wireless networks.\n>\n> The talk will touch upon the speaker’s contributions to three challenging\n> problems in wireless LAN (WLAN, commonly called “Wi-Fi”) system design that\n> form some of the core technology in flagship wireless LAN SoC products. The\n> first two topics pertain to some of his work at  Broadcom on the general\n> problem of wireless coexistence, where devices with very different\n> communication requirements and constraints share a common spectrum. The\n> roles of interference avoidance, mitigation and adaptation are discussed in\n> the context of specific examples. It is pointed out how a holistic\n> perspective on the system-level impact of interference is necessary for\n> significantly improved coexistence. The third topic is selected to present\n> some of his work at Redpine Signals, Inc., that concerns the design of\n> low-complexity soft-output MIMO demodulators. It is shown how reasonably\n> accurate Likelihood-Ratios (LLRs) can be obtained without the need for\n> matrix inversion when the number of spatial streams is small, a scenario of\n> practical interest.\n>\n> As part of his doctoral research, the speaker has worked on multiple\n> theoretical and experimental topics. One representative topic from each\n> methodology will be presented here. The experimental work will discuss the\n> development of the first known prototype of a superposition coded wireless\n> system that was implemented on a software radio platform. In addition to\n> systematically developing experimentally robust analogs and methodologies\n> to theoretical constructs (such as the information-theoretic rate region),\n> this line of work also investigates some approaches that can leverage\n> superposition coding in practice. The theoretical topic will discuss his\n> work on deriving asymptotic scaling laws for the convergence behavior for a\n> class of distributed signal processing algorithms called average consensus\n> algorithms when message exchange between network nodes occurs over an\n> interference-limited wireless network. By combining the mathematical tools\n> from Markov chain theory, geometric random graph theory and information\n> theory, this line of work was the first to establish convergence results on\n> this algorithm in the presence of interference. In particular, it\n> challenges the long-held view that increased communication range always\n> improves the rate of convergence to consensus.\n>\n> The talk ends with some thoughts on the emergence of device heterogeneity,\n> and some challenges this poses in the context of the emerging Internet of\n> Things (IoT).\n>\n> Speaker bio: Sundaram Vanka received the B. Tech. and M. Tech. degrees\n> from the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras in 2003, and the Ph. D.\n> degree from the University of Notre Dame, Indiana, United States of America\n> in 2012, all in Electrical Engineering.

So in that left over/leisure time, why\ndon't you consider doing something fun and actually useful for the society?\n\nYoung Leaders' Initiative is a program where you can teach what you love to\nthe students of rural areas, who have lesser opportunities than us.\nSo the program is just for 15 days (that's a decent amount of time, but\nstill) and you'll have to stay in a rural area, teaching kids (7th to 12th\nclass) what you opt for.\n\nTry giving it a thought, I know all seems quite a little of a drag, but\nthen you'll be learning a lot, making new friends and doing good for the\nchildren.\n\nNow, for the rewards part(All we care about us this xD). You get around\n5000/- to 7000/- upon completion for the program, depending on your\nproficiency.\n\nFor the TL;DR people, basically this is a social cause which allows you to\nteach children from the lower backrounds what you love and you get paid for\ndoing so.\n\nWhere, when and all can be found here\nhttp://www.youngleadersinitiative.com\n\nP.S.

Let me explain. I had joined my college about 5 months\nback. My parents expected me to be studious and get placed into a top\ncompany with ideally a 7 figure salary. So, I would study hard, even at the\ncost of being made fun of and bullied. But I also made sure that I\nsocialised, made friends, and pursued a sport.\nA semester went by. I was at home for the sem break when my exam results\nwere announced. I had scored a 8.75 GPA. It was decent, or so I thought.\nThen my parents saw it and suddenly it felt like someone had died in the\nhouse.“You have brought shame to the family”, my dad said. My heart sank. I\nwas in the top 20 of my class, and here I was being treated like a failure\nby my own parents.\nFor the next 1 year, my parents would check up on me at least 5 times in a\nday. If I didn’t answer my phone, they'd call my roommate. If I was out\nwith friends, I would get yelled at for throwing away my life. I wasn’t\nallowed to have fun anymore. I slipped into depression, skipping classes,\nmeals, and even socialising. My self-confidence and self-esteem hit\nrock-bottom. I had no idea what to do, and had to finally consider the idea\nof counseling.\nBut I wasn’t ready to meet with a counselor in person. That’s when I came\nacross a poster on my campus about an online counseling portal. I decided\nto give it a shot. I got onto the portal, and was connected with Ruchi.\nWill she judge me?”, “How can she ever help me?”, “This is a bad idea”,\nwere some of the thoughts running in my head. But Ruchi made me feel so\ncomfortable. I can tell you that with her, I got exactly what I needed,\ncompassion, empathy, guidance and a patient ear, without even a tinge of\njudgement.\nAs I got more comfortable with her, I took her suggestion and we moved to\nsessions over Skype. At her request, I asked my parents to speak with her.\nAt first, they were angry. “Why do you need counseling?” “What mistakes did\nwe ever make to see this day?”, they said. But on my repeated pleadings,\nthey gave in. The change in their behaviour was miraculous. It was like I\nhad lost my parents and had now found them again. 3 months later, I emerged\nfrom counseling with renewed vigour, confidence, and self-worth. Most\nimportantly, I felt hope - hope that I could be happy again.\nIn July 2018, I joined my first job in one of the world’s foremost\nconsultancy firms with a 7 figure salary. In the end, I just have one thing\nto say, neither is counseling something to be scared of, nor is it\nsomething to be ashamed of.\nGot something on your mind that’s troubling you?\n\nWe’re here for you. connect with an expert now\n<https://yourdost.com/chatSession/?workgroup=demo@workgroup.chat.yourdost.com&yd_source=IITDh_NL&yd_medium=IITDhEmail&yd_campaign=ScaredCase&yd_term=19>\n\nYourDOST\n","1372":"Subject: Talk on \"Coordination of Networked Dynamical Systems: Formation Control, Passivation and Network Optimization\"\nText: Dear all,\n\nA talk by Dr. Anoop Jain is scheduled as follows:\n\n*Title*: Coordination of Networked Dynamical Systems: Formation Control,\nPassivation and Network Optimization\n*Date & Time*: 4:30 pm on 9th April, 2019\n*Venue*: Room No.21\n\n*Abstract*: Networked dynamical systems possess improved robustness\nproperties over single agent systems, and hence, are desirable for various\nengineering applications ranging from searching and sensing, tracking and\nmonitoring, surveillance and patrolling to cooperative space missions. To\naccomplish such cooperative tasks autonomously, the agents are required to\ncoordinate with each other depending on their sensing capabilities, which\nis represented by a graph (usually referred to as communication network).\nThe first part of my talk will focus on achieving a collective motion in\nmulti-agent systems where the agents are either in a synchronized or a\nbalanced formation. Such formations are characterized by the motion of the\ncollective centroid of the group of agents and serve as motion primitives\nto achieve general tracking patterns. In the existing literature, the\nproblems of achieving synchronization and balancing have been studied under\nthe assumption that the agents are coupled through controller gains that\nare identical or homogeneous. In this talk, I plan to discuss a practical\nscenario where the gains may vary nominally due to minor implementation\nerrors or drastically due to major faults or errors, thus leading to\nheterogeneity in controller gains. Robustness and fault tolerant properties\nof these formations against the failure of controllers will also be\npresented. Furthermore, stabilization of more general formation patterns,\nsuch that the trajectories of the agents do not transgress a given\nworkspace, will also be discussed.\nThe second part of my talk will focus on cooperative control of\nheterogeneous dynamical systems that possess shortage of passivity or\nnon-passiveness in their operation. Due to passivity-shortage, the\nconvergence of the network is not guaranteed in the closed loop operation,\nwhich is usually the case in practice. An input-output transformation\nbased  generalized passivation approach will be discussed to ensure their\npassivity properties in terms of maximal equilibrium passivity, which is a\ngeneralization to the classical passivity theory. We then show that the\nsteady-state behavior of these systems are in fact solutions to a family of\nclassic network optimization problems, and as a result we draw connections\nbetween notions of duality in static optimization to cooperative control.\nFinally, the presentation will be concluded by a brief discussion about\nsome future directions of the work.\n\n*About the Speaker: *Dr. Anoop Jain is currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at\nthe Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, Technion – Israel Institute of\nTechnology.
